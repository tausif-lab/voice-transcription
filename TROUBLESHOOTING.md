## Testing Your Setup

### 1. Test API Key Validation
Visit: `http://localhost:3000/validate-api`

This will tell you if your API key is working without using quota.

### 2. Test Server Health
Visit: `http://localhost:3000/health`

This should return server status information.

### 3. Check Server Logs
Look at the terminal/console where you started the server for detailed error messages.
